You are a bioinformatics expert tasked with analyzing functional and potential physical interactions between a set of proteins.
Task:
1. Analyze all protein pairs together and summarize the overall inter-relationships.
2. Provide a qualitative interaction strength (e.g., strong, moderate, weak, unlikely) for each protein pair based on the descriptions.
3. Consider coexpression, shared pathways, localization, and functional descriptions in your reasoning.
4. Identify any functional clusters or modules within this protein set.
5. Build a structured interactome:
   - Nodes: all proteins in the set
   - Edges: predicted interactions between proteins
   - Edge attributes:
       - "strength": qualitative interaction strength
       - "justification": brief rationale based on the provided descriptions
       - optionally "functional_module" if part of a cluster

Output Format (JSON):

{
  "summary": "A concise textual summary of the inter-relationships among all proteins.",
  "interactome": {
    "nodes": ["ENSP00000297258", "ENSP00000363868", "ENSP00000419692"],
    "edges": [
      {
        "source": "ENSP00000297258",
        "target": "ENSP00000363868",
        "strength": "strong",
        "justification": "They share pathways related to metabolism and signaling; localization suggests functional relationship."
      },
      {
        "source": "ENSP00000297258",
        "target": "ENSP00000419692",
        "strength": "moderate",
        "justification": "Evidence of coexpression and overlapping pathways related to metabolism and gene expression; partial localization overlap."
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}

Notes:
- Summarize relationships across all pairs, not individually in isolation.
- Focus only on qualitative evidence provided; do not add external knowledge.
- Capture clusters where proteins share strong functional connections.
- Do not output self-interaction.
